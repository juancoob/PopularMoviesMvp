# PopularMoviesMvp

This is the popular movies project stage 2 from Udacity Android Nanodegree. Don't forget adding your API KEY on the app's build gradle

Now it's implemented using MVP Clean Pattern thanks to https://medium.com/@dmilicic/a-detailed-guide-on-developing-android-apps-using-the-clean-architecture-pattern-d38d71e94029

It will be improved on the next version:

* MVP pattern: Of course, this is my first time implementing it, so I think It could be inproved.
* UI: Despite I did some changes, I could add more functionalities as FAB
* tests: Due to the submit date and the time I used to learn MVP Clean, I couldn't implement them


Libraries used:

* constraint:constraint-layout:1.1.0' -> Brings the new constraint layout
* recyclerview-v7:27.1.1'             -> Adds the recyclerView functionality
* cardview-v7:27.1.1'                 -> Adds the card style
* picasso:2.5.2                       -> Manages images
* butterknife:8.8.1                   -> Manages bidings
* retrofit2:retrofit:2.4.0            -> Manages HTTP requests
